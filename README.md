# Distribute Systems Project

Distributed System that lets users interact with a Web Client GUI built with Spring Boot to do CRUD operations for a Car Hire Booking System.

The RESTful Server that is being consumed by the Client was built in JAX-RS Jersey and is connected to a database over RMI that stores all of the Car Hire Bookings.
